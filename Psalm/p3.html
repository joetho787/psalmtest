           <h1>Psalm 3</h1>
<h2>A psalm of David. When he fled from his son Absalom.</h2>
Lord, how many are my foes!<br>
How many rise up against me!<br>
Many are saying of me,<br>
“God will not deliver him.”<br>
But you, Lord, are a shield around me,<br>
my glory, the One who lifts my head high.<br>
I call out to the Lord,<br>
and he answers me from his holy mountain.<br>

I lie down and sleep;<br>
I wake again, because the Lord sustains me.<br>
I will not fear though tens of thousands<br>
assail me on every side.<br>

Arise, Lord!<br>
Deliver me, my God!<br>
Strike all my enemies on the jaw;<br>
break the teeth of the wicked.<br>

From the Lord comes deliverance.<br>
May your blessing be on your people.<br>
