        <h1>Psalm 91:::</h1>
<span>He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the <em>Almighty</em>.</span>
<br>I will say of the <em>LORD</em>, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.
<br>

Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.
<br>
He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
<br>
Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;
Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
<br>
A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.
<br>
Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.
<br>
        Because thou hast made the <em>LORD</em>, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;
<br>
There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.
<br>
For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
<br>They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
<br>Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
<br>Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
<br>He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.
        <br>With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
