            <p id="Pbdy">Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked<br>
            or stand in the way that sinners take<br>
            or sit in the company of mockers,<br>
            but whose delight is in the law of the Lord,<br>
            and who meditates on his law day and night.<br>
            That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,<br>
            which yields its fruit in season<br>
            and whose leaf does not witherâ€”<br>
            whatever they do prospers.<br>
            Not so the wicked!<br>
            They are like chaff<br>
            that the wind blows away.<br>
            Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,<br>
            nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.<br>
            For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous,<br>
            but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.<br>
