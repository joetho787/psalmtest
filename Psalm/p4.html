            <h1>Psalm 4</h1>
            <h4>For the director of music. With stringed instruments. A psalm of David.</h4>
            Answer me when I call to you,<br>
            my righteous God.<br>
            Give me relief from my distress;<br>
            have mercy on me and hear my prayer.<br>
            How long will you people turn my glory into shame?<br>
            How long will you love delusions and seek false gods[b]?<br>
            Know that the Lord has set apart his faithful servant for himself;<br>
        the Lord hears when I call to him.<br>
            Tremble and[d] do not sin;<br>
            when you are on your beds,<br>
            search your hearts and be silent.<br>
            Offer the sacrifices of the righteous<br>
            and trust in the Lord.<br>
            Many, Lord, are asking, “Who will bring us prosperity?”<br>
            Let the light of your face shine on us.<br>
            Fill my heart with joy<br>
            when their grain and new wine abound.<br>
            In peace I will lie down and sleep,<br>
            for you alone, Lord,<br>
            make me dwell in safety.<br>
