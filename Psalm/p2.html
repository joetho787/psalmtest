        <h1>Psalm 23</h1>
        <div class="Psalm">
            
            <br>
        <p id="Pbdy">    Why do the nations conspire<br>
        and the peoples plot in vain?<br>
        The kings of the earth rise up<br>
        and the rulers band together<br>
        against the Lord and against his anointed, saying,<br>
        “Let us break their chains<br>
        and throw off their shackles.”<br>

        The One enthroned in heaven laughs;<br>
        the Lord scoffs at them.<br>
        He rebukes them in his anger<br>
        and terrifies them in his wrath, saying,<br>
        “I have installed my king<br>
        on Zion, my holy mountain.”<br>

        I will proclaim the Lord’s decree:<br>

        He said to me, “You are my son;<br>
        today I have become your father.<br>
        Ask me,<br>
        and I will make the nations your inheritance,<br>
        the ends of the earth your possession.<br>
        You will break them with a rod of iron;<br>
        you will dash them to pieces like pottery.”<br>

        Therefore, you kings, be wise;<br>
        be warned, you rulers of the earth.<br>
        Serve the Lord with fear<br>
        and celebrate his rule with trembling.<br>
        Kiss his son, or he will be angry<br>
        and your way will lead to your destruction,<br>
        for his wrath can flare up in a moment.<br>
        Blessed are all who take refuge in him.<br>
