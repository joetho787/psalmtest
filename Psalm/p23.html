            <h1>Psalm 23</h1>
            <br>
            The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
            <br>
            He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
            <br>
            He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
            <br>
            Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil:<br> for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
            <br>
            Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:<br> thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
            <br>
            Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever
